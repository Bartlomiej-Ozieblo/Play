##Bugs
The main bug is memory leak, caused probably by mechanism that update progress bar. I don't know how to repair this, if you can give me any hint I'll be grateful. :) <br />And also equalizer is not finished (or even started).

##Notes
Software was tested on Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't know if layout will look properly on other devices.
